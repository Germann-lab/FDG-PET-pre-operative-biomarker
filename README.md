These three region-of-interests were used to sample regional pre-operative FDG-PET values from patients who underwent SCC-DBS. We trained an SVM model to classify response status at 12 months post-op in an initial SCC-DBS cohort (n=21) based on these FDG-PET features. The model was then validated in a second, out-of-sample SCC-DBS cohort (n=35). Please see the corresponding paper (INSERT CITATION/DOI ONCE PUBLISHED) for further details.
